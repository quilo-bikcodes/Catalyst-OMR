# Catalyst App

Catalyst is a simple web application designed for managing questions and responses in a structured manner. The app provides a clean interface with two main sections â€“ a left card for potential features or content and a right section divided into two parts. The upper part of the right section contains a container for question notations, while the lower part consists of rounded buttons for clearing responses and submitting answers.
